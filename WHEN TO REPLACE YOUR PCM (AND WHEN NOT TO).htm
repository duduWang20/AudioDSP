<p>The onboard computer is the brains of the engine control system, so when the 
brain isn't functioning correctly neither is the engine or anything else that 
the microprocessor controls - which may include the charging system, 
transmission, various emission controls and communications with other onboard 
control modules. Once a diagnosis has been made (and I emphasize the word 
diagnosis), then and only then should the PCM be replaced. </p>
       
<p>All too often, the blame falls on what is least understood. If an 
engine isn’t running right and the cause isn’t obvious, blame the 
computer. Throwing parts at a problem in an attempt to solve it may be good for 
the parts business, but attempting to return a replacement PCM because it didn’t fix 
the problem isn’t good for anyone. Warranty returns on complicated and 
expensive components like powertrain control modules can be tricky and are a no-win situation for everyone. </p>

<h1><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC0000"><strong>UNNECESSARY RETURNS</strong></font></h1>

<p>Over 50 percent of PCMs that are returned under warranty 
have nothing wrong with them! So it’s obvious a lot of people are swapping computers to see if a 
different PCM will fix their problem.</p>

<p>The trouble with returns is if the PCM has been on the car, you have no way of 
knowing if it is still "good" or not. Somebody may have crossed up some wires, 
zapped the PCM with too much voltage or who knows what? The computer needs to be 
tested and verified before it can go back on the shelf and be sold to somebody 
else. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there’s no easy way of doing that in a parts store. The PCM has 
to be hooked up to a sophisticated simulator that exercises all of the 
computer’s input and output circuits to make sure it works correctly - which 
means the PCM has to go back to the supplier, be retested, and if no fault is 
found, repackaged and put back into stock.
You can understand then why many parts stores have a policy of "no returns or 
refunds on electronic components." </p>

<p>So - don't even think about replacing that PCM until you're confident that you've properly diagnosed the problem.</p>

<h1><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC0000"><strong>WHY DID IT DIE? </strong></font></h1>

<p>One way to reduce the risk of PCM warranty problems is to find out why the old 
PCM died. Determining the cause of death may not always be possible, but it may 
be essential to prevent the same thing from damaging the replacement PCM in some 
cases. </p>

<p>PCMs typically fail for one of two reasons: voltage overloads (often due to a 
short in a solenoid or actuator circuit) or environmental factors (corrosion, 
thermal stress or vibration). If the shorted solenoid or actuator isn’t found 
and repaired, the voltage overload it creates may damage the replacement PCM, 
too.
</p>

<p>As for environmental factors, water is the main thing to avoid. If water gets 
inside a PCM, it can short circuits and set up irreversible corrosion that ruins 
electronic connections. Most remanufacturers won’t even attempt to repair a PCM 
if the vehicle it came out of was submerged in a flood. Replacement is the only 
option. Thermal stress and vibration can form microcracks in circuit boards 
(which are repairable). This often has more to due with the ruggedness of the 
circuit design than operation factors in the vehicle itself.</p>

<h1><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC0000"><strong>ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION</strong></font></h1>

<p>Because there are so many different PCMs, accurate identification of the PCM and 
its correct replacement is absolutely essential to prevent unnecessary returns. 
Many PCMs appear to be exactly the same on the outside (same sized box and 
connectors) but may be wired or calibrated differently inside. 
If the wrong PCM is installed in a vehicle, it may run but probably won’t run 
well. Close enough isn’t good enough when it comes to replacing PCMs. It must be 
the correct replacement for the application.</p>

<p>Accurately identifying the PCM requires not only the vehicle year, make, model 
and engine size, but also the OEM part number on the PCM itself. Most supplier’s 
catalogs list replacement PCMs both ways. So if in doubt, always refer to the 
OEM number on the PCM and look it up in the suppliers cross reference index to 
find their replacement part number.</p>

<p>The calibration chip and PROM contains the programming instructions for the 
vehicle application. That’s why it usually doesn’t come with the replacement 
PCM. There are too many different possibilities. On many newer vehicles, flash 
memory or "EEPROMs" (Electronically Erasable Program Read Only Memory) are used. 
If the replacement PROM is not properly programmed for the application, it must 
be reprogrammed after it has been installed. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the ability to do this type of reprogramming is not readily 
available to the aftermarket. The car makers don’t want aftermarket technicians 
messing around with the calibration of their onboard computers because they’re 
afraid doing so may alter emissions or performance. But that’s another issue. 
One such example is Chrysler transmission modules. They must be reset with the 
factory DRB scan tool and dealer codes to set the "pinion factor," which 
controls the operation of the speedometer.  </p>

<h1><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC0000"><strong>REMAN PCMs</strong></font></h1>

<p>Because PCMs are fairly expensive, almost all aftermarket replacement PCMs are 
"remanufactured" units. PCMs are not rebuilt in the same way that alternators 
and water pumps because there are no mechanical parts that wear out. 
Remanufacturing in this case usually means testing the computer, isolating and 
repairing any faults that may be found, then retesting the computer to make sure 
everything works correctly.</p>

<p>Remanufactured PCMs are typically sold one of two ways: on an exchange basis 
from stock, or on a custom rebuild basis. If a particular PCM is not in stock or 
is unavailable, you can often send the old PCM to a remanufacturer 
for repair. Turn around time is typically a few days and the cost is the same as 
selling him an exchange unit from stock (except there’s no core charge).
Some PCMs, though, may not be repairable. As we said earlier, most 
remanufacturers will not even touch a PCM if it came out of a flooded vehicle.
</p>

<h1><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC0000"><strong>REPLACEMENT TIPS</strong></font></h1>

<p>Replacing a PCM is essentially a matter of swapping boxes. Accessibility can be 
a problem on some vehicles because the PCM is often buried under or behind other 
components in the instrument panel, climate control system or console. Some are 
located under a seat and require removing the seat.</p>

<p>Regardless of the PCM’s location, though, one thing every installer should do 
(but many don’t) prior to removing the old PCM and installing the replacement 
PCM is disconnect the battery.</p>

<p>Once the PCM has been installed and reconnected, the battery can be reconnected, 
too. But the job isn’t done yet. Many PCMs have to undergo a "relearning" 
procedure after they’ve been installed or if they’ve been disconnected from the 
battery. 
</p>

<p>On some applications, there may be a specific procedure for establishing the 
base idle speed. On others, it may be necessary to take the vehicle for a short 
test drive so the computer can adjust itself. The exact requirements will be 
spelled out in the vehicle’s service manual, but that doesn’t mean the installer 
has access to a manual or will use it. So the best advice here is to test drive 
the vehicle after the computer has been installed. A short drive cycle that 
includes going over 35 mph will usually reset most computers so they run 
properly.</p>

<p>Most PCMs will also continue to learn and make small adjustments to the fuel 
mixture and other functions over time as the vehicle accumulates miles. If the 
PCM also controls the transmission, it may take awhile to relearn the driver’s 
habits so the transmission may not shift exactly the same as before until this 
occurs.</p>

<p>Finally, if the Malfunction Indicator or Check Engine light comes back on after 
the PCM has been replaced, it means there’s still a problem with the vehicle - 
not the PCM (assuming the code is not one for an internal PCM fault, in which 
case the PCM would be saying it is faulty). The presence of fault codes means 
something else is wrong that needs to be diagnosed and repaired. So until the 
real problem is found and fixed, the PCM may not function normally. </p>

<p>If the engine control system is not going into closed loop, chances are the 
coolant sensor or oxygen sensor are not working properly. If spark timing seems 
to be over advanced or retarded, the problem may be a faulty MAP sensor, 
misadjusted throttle position sensor or overly sensitive knock sensor. And if 
nothing seems to work right, low charging voltage due to a weak alternator or 
poor battery connections may be the fault.</p>

<p>Remember, the PCM needs all its sensor inputs, proper battery voltage, a good 
ground and the ability to send out control signals to function normally. </p>
